Clothes brand gets 100 complaints a day that models are 'too fat',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xjd41g33o,"The boss of online clothing brand Snag has told the BBC it gets more than 100 complaints a day that the models in its adverts are ""too fat"". Chief executive Brigitte Read says models of her size 4-38 clothing are frequently the target of ""hateful"" posts about their weight. The brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing ""unhealthily fat"" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which amodel appeared ""unhealthily thin"", was banned. The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin. But it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag. Catherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it ""hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity"". The 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme. Mrs Thom says she was ""bombarded with images of obese girls in tights"" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant. ""I see Snag tights plastering these morbidly obese people all over social media,"" she says. ""How is that allowed when the photo of the Next model isn't? There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful."" But Snag founder Ms Read says: ""Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health."" She thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's ""fat phobia"". Of her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated ""just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity"". ""Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,"" she says. ""You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented."" Sophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media. ""I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people."" Sophie is used to online comments telling her she is ""unhealthy"", but says, ""fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels. ""People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'. Perhaps some people are looking at me and saying 'she has a similar body type to me'. ""When I get a message from someone saying 'we are the same size and you've inspired me to wear what I want', it takes away from every hate comment I get. ""If I've helped one person accept their body then the hate comments don't really bother me."" Fashion journalist Victoria Moss believes the ""depressing"" debate shows society is not used to seeing bigger bodies in advertising campaigns. ""You'd be pretty hard pushed to find genuine plus-size models on retailers' websites because even a mid-size is a 10/12 and plus is 14/16 which is actually around the average size for a woman in the UK,"" she says. ""The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter."" Jess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight. She says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight. Adverts simply promoting body confidence and using a model who is relevant to the product's size range would not be investigated. ""It's to do with the wider societal context. We know in the UK currently society tends to view thinness as aspirational and that's not the case for being overweight.""

Labour may have ditched its factional in-fighting - but deep welfare cuts could reignite tensions.

Greenland's politicians unite against Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ljrjeqzq4o,"Greenland's leading political parties have issued a joint statement to condemn Donald Trump's ""unacceptable behaviour"", after the US president seemed to escalate his campaign to take over the island. The show of unity saw all leaders of parties in the Inatsisartut - the parliament - release a joint message saying they ""cannot accept the repeated statements about annexation and control of Greenland"". It follows a meeting between Trump and Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte on Thursday, where the president seemed to double down on his annexation plan. Greenland's joint statement was orchestrated by outgoing Prime Minister Mute B Egede, whose party was defeated in an election on Tuesday. ""Our country will never be the USA and we Greenlanders will never be Americans,"" Egede wrote on Facebook. ""Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough."" Greenland - the world's biggest island, between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years. Greenland governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long had a security interest in the island. It has had a military base there since World War Two, and Trump is probably also keen on the rare earth minerals that could be mined. Greenland was already on the defensive about Trump's annexing talk, but his comments to Rutte at the White House sent further shockwaves when he implied that Nato's help might be needed to seize the island. ""You know, Mark, we need that for international security... we have a lot of our favourite players cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful,"" Trump said. ""We'll be talking to you,"" he added. When asked about the prospect of annexation, Trump said: ""I think that will happen."" Rutte has been criticised in both Greenland and Denmark for not reprimanding Trump. Instead, he said he would ""leave that [issue] outside... I do not want to drag Nato into that"". He then pivoted to praise - something several world leaders have used when dealing with Donald Trump - saying he was ""totally right"" that security in the Arctic must be maintained. Thejoint statementfrom Greenland's politicians emphasised that they are united in their pushback against Trump's plan. ""Greenland continues the work for Greenland,"" the statement said. ""We all stand behind this effort and strongly distance ourselves from attempts to create discord."" Their decision to speak out came three days after elections in which the centre-right opposition - the Democratic Party - won a surprise victory. Its leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is likely to be Greenland's new prime minister, is now negotiating with other parties to form a coalition. The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification. The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks. A judge ordered a 14-day halt on deporting Venezuelans under a Trump order that declared them enemies. Campaigners in St Louis want support for those who claim to have become ill due to research into the atomic bomb.

It's not a competition! The collaborative video game loved by players,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ljgp4v48no,"Think of video games, and you'll probably think of something competitive. Some of the most popular titles in the world, such as Fortnite and Call of Duty, are focused on outgunning, outrunning or outclassing opponents. But, as Josef Fares and his studio Hazelight have shown, that's not the only thing gamers want. His latest, Split Fiction, is a collaborative experience where two players work together to solve puzzles and beat obstacles. The adventure game has received rave reviews, sold one million copies in 48 hours and is currently among the most-watched titles on streaming platform Twitch. It's not a one-off. His previous title, It Takes Two, featured similar ""couch co-op"" gameplay and sold 20 million copies and won a Game of the Year Award. What draws players to these friendlier experiences? A report from analytics company Midia Research found that couch co-op was especially popular among people aged 16 to 24. It surveyed 9,000 gamers worldwide, and said roughly 40% of respondents in the age range reported it was their preferred way to play. The report said ""social play is a key part of gaming for younger consumers,"" and suggested more developers could look to incorporate collaborative elements. Co-operative games are also big with streamers - watching players bicker as they try to conquer a new title is a great source of viral moments. Last year Chained Together, where players work together to escape the depths of hell, was a hit thanks to huge names like Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed getting in on the action. Couple Melissa and Jonn-Mark, from Middlesbrough, have been uploading clips of themselves playing Split Fiction together to TikTok. The game centres around fantasy author Zoe and sci-fi writer Mio, who become trapped in simulated versions of their own stories. Melissa, a keen reader, says the plot appealed to her, but the chance to team up got her invested. ""A lot of the time when you play video games you are isolated from other people and it's just nice to be together, spend that quality time together,"" Melissa tells Newsbeat. Jonn-Mark says popular online games are often very competitive, which can be stressful. ""I don't want to have to come home tired and have to focus 100% to just be able to do ok at a game,"" he says. ""Whereas this one, I can just sit back, relax and just enjoy the experience."" What Hazelight does is unique, but other companies do implement co-op features into their titles. Guildford-based Supermassive Games, which specialises in ""interactive horror movies"", made couch co-op a standard mode in its titles after publishing its breakout hit Until Dawn. They found players were going through the single-player title in groups, passing the pad between them as the narrative - which changes based on choices made in-game - progressed. Competitive social play is also popular. Some of the best-selling games on Nintendo's Switch system - Mario Kart 8 and the Mario Party series - are frequently played with mates around the TV. In recent years, developers have tried to replicate the success of games like Fortnite - so-called ""live service"" titles that constantly update and retain players for months, if not years. If you get it right, the potential financial rewards are huge, but cutting through in a saturated market is difficult. And as the video games industry continuesto deal with mass layoffs, studio closures and decreased spending on premium games, not many publishers want to take a risk. Josef believes there may be too much focus on the bottom line. ""Publishers need to step up and really trust the developer,"" he says. ""But also developers, I think, need to have a clear vision and stick with what they believe in."" He does admit, though, that not everyone has his studio's history, nor his personality. ""I am a - what do you say? - a different breed,"" says Josef. When he was directing his first game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, feedback from some early playtests was ""super bad"". ""I'm like, they're wrong, they're wrong, because I know it's great,"" he says. He's spoken before about resisting pressure to put micro-transactions - in-game purchases - in his projects, and is uncompromising despite his studio's close relationship with EA, one of the world's biggest publishers. ""I don't expect everybody to be like me, but that's me with my extreme confidence,"" he says. ""What we do, I love it. ""We're sticking to the vision of what we believe in. Stick with the vision, go with it. ""And I think if you really love what you do people love it as well."" Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere.

Prospect of Ukraine ceasefire still uncertain despite Trump's optimism,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2z1459lzo,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Vladimir Putin of trying to ""sabotage"" diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire. In a post on social media, he urged the US to put more pressure on the Russian president, saying only the ""strength of America"" could end the war. The Ukrainian leader said Putin was ""doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire"". At his press conference on Thursday, Putin said he accepted the idea of a ceasefirebut qualified that with numerous questions about detail. He raised the Kursk border region, where Russian forces areretaking territory occupied by Ukraine six months ago. He accused Ukrainian forces of ""heinous crimes against civilians"" – something Kyiv denies - and asked whether they should walk free or surrender. He asked about whether Ukraine would use a ceasefire to mobilise, retrain and resupply its troops, without suggesting his forces might do the same. And Putin raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east. ""Who will be able to determine who violated the potential ceasefire agreement over a distance of 2,000 km and where exactly?"" he asked. ""Who will be held responsible for violating the ceasefire?"" At a meeting with journalists on Friday, Zelensky addressed these issues directly, especially the questions about verification. He said Ukraine was more than able to verify a ceasefire in the air and the sea. But he said the surveillance and intelligence capabilities of American and European aircraft and satellites would be needed to monitor the front line. Ukraine believes Putin's conditions of detail can be addressed. Much harder to deal with are Putin's objections of principle. He said any deal should ""proceed from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis"". By that, he means his objections to the expansion of the Nato military alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign independent state. There is very little chance of that being addressed in any immediate interim ceasefire. Not for nothing did G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada emphasise Ukraine's territorial integrity ""and its right to exist and its freedom, sovereignty and independence"". This is why Zelensky said ""Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down"". So what could happen now? Well the ball is in America's court. President Trump could choose to step up pressure on Russia as Ukraine is demanding. He could impose more sanctions on Russia - and countries buying its cheap oil and gas. He could also give more military and intelligence support to Ukraine. Or alternatively Trump could offer Russia more concessions to get a deal over the line, a possibility that worries some here in Kyiv. Much of the contact between the US and Russia has been held in secret compared to the very public diplomatic pressure imposed on Ukraine. That is why Zelensky is calling out Russia's delaying tactics and urging the West to put more pressure on Putin. He may also be enjoying seeing Russia in the spotlight, having been the butt of American diplomatic efforts for more than a month since Trump and Putin had their first telephone call. The bottom line is that Trump has driven a diplomatic bulldozer through many international issues since his inauguration, including the war in Ukraine. But now he has come up against the walls of the Kremlin and they may be harder to get through. Trump wants a fast end to the fighting. Putin wants a ""painstaking"" discussion about details and principles. Two incompatible imperatives held by two stubborn leaders used to getting their way. Who will blink first? The prospects of a ceasefire are by no means certain, for all the American expressions of ""cautious optimism"". The BBC asks people in Kyiv whether a ceasefire deal could be a step towards ending war with Russia. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Russia of dragging out ceasefire talks so it can continue the war.

The untold story of the battle that helped end WW2 in Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q1wn9zy3xo,"Operation Varsity ""was the battle that ended"" World War Two in Europe, yet it is largely unknown to all but military history buffs. British, Canadian and American forces took off mostly from Essex airfields on 24 March 1945, to be dropped directly on top of the German lines at the River Rhine. Paratroopers and gliders packed with men descended into fierce fighting conditions which resulted in rapid success, but huge loss of life. About six weeks later, the Western Allies had met the Russians in Berlin and Victory in Europe was declared. Chris Bullock has organised an event at one of the departure airfields, RAF Rivenhall, to remember those who died, saying ""it's an untold story"". ""When you see  a video of the men at Rivenhall with their final brew, giving the thumbs up and the V for victory sign before they get into their gliders and you know some of them didn't come home, within three hours they were dead – it's important to tell that story,"" he said. Peter Davies, 102, took off from RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk towed by a Dakota plane and carrying ""a 17-pounder gun, towing vehicleand gun detachment of eight personnel"". He had volunteered for the Glider Pilot Regiment in 1942 because he thought it would be ""more exciting"" than his time as an Army private manning a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft unit. ""It's like flying a brick – there's only one way, and it's down,"" said Mr Davies, from Bollington, Cheshire, describing what it was like once the the glider was loosed. ""There was a hell of a lot of flak, we lost our controls and having lost a great chunk of one wing, we were pulling deeper and deeper into enemy ground. ""When we hit the ground – and I do mean hit – we were very much in the wrong place amongst a load of very angry Germans, and it was total chaos."" One American glider came down within 50m (about 160ft) of him, ""and not one man got out alive because the Germans were there as well"". But with co-pilot Bert Bowman, he made it across the battlefield to their intended drop zone and returned to Britain. ""The Allies landed directly on top of the Germans and lots of gliders were shot down and lots of paratroopers were shot in the skies – 80 people from RAF Rivenhall alone lost their lives,"" said Mr Bullock, 56, who served in the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment for 25 years. Operation Varsity was the largest single airborne operation in history, with more than 16,000 men were dropped into western Germany on the same day. Its aim was to establish a bridgehead across the River Rhine for the main Allied advance into Germany and push rapidly towards the Russian forces arriving from the east. The first part was the ground offensive Operation Plunder, ""which was the biggest-ever river crossing and was done by British and Canadian forces"", Mr Bullock said. The intention was for the amphibious troops on the western side of the Rhine to join up with the airborne troops dropped to its east. Varsity took place just five months after the disastrous Battle of Arnhem, whichresulted in 90% casualties to the Glider Pilot Regiment. RAF pilots such as Brian Latham, who had been sent to Texas, to learn to fly fighter planes, were among hundreds who ""volunteered"" for glider service. ""If we didn't volunteer, we were told we'd never fly again and be made to join the infantry or go down a mine,"" said Mr Latham, 101, from Llandudno, Conway, Wales. However, he soon realised being a gilder pilot was ""an elite, like the Commandos"". ""We were not toughies and they made us toughies – I became a trained infantry man,"" he said. Flying from RAF Gosfield, near Braintree, Essex, Mr Latham carried a mortar section, with a Jeep and trailer, and was dropped into ground smoke and heavy anti-aircraft fire. ""We just dived into the smoke and it was all very exciting and we landed just where we should have done at Hamminkeln,"" he said. ""We were then by a bridge, held by the Royal Ulster Rifles, which was attacked by German tanks until the British 2nd Army came up [having crossed the Rhine]."" Eventually he was returned to the UK, but grateful not to go back to his home station of RAF Broadwell in Oxfordshire, because ""we'd lost too many people"". Of the 890 Glider Pilot Regiment personnel who took part in Varsity, more than 20% of them were killed or wounded. ""We were dropped right in amongst the Germans, which had never been tried before, and we knew it was a suicide drop,"" said Danny Mason, who had qualified to join the Parachute Regiment aged 19 just a week earlier. ""But it didn't bother us. We were young and keen and thought, 'We'll be all right, we'll be fine'."" Now 98 and living in Ludlow, Shropshire, Mr Mason added: ""We also thought the Germans were losing and weren't in good fighting condition and this'll be easy – but it wasn't. We had a very high casualty rate."" At least 1,070 membersof the US 17th Airborne Division and the British 6th Airborne Division, which included the Canadians, were killed and thousands more were wounded. ""But within four or five hours we had accomplished what we had set out to do,"" Mr Mason said. He advanced 600 miles through Germany within a fortnight until he was injured. ""It was the battle that ended the war, yet nobody was interested in it,"" he said. ""I asked my old commanding officer about it and he said it was because everyone was fed up. It was six years of war and it was such a huge relief when VE Day came."" Mr Bullock provided some additional context. ""Three weeks after Varsity, Belsen concentration camp was liberated. Two weeks after, Hitler killed himself, and a week after that Germany capitulated – it's probably hardly talked about because events overtook themselves."" Now working as an international operations security manager for the BBC, he lives near RAF Rivenhall and began researching its story 10 years ago. Sixty gliders towed by two RAF squadrons left the airfield at 07:00 GMT on 24 March 1945, carrying part of the 6th Airborne Division. But some of that history is still lost. ""There are no records left of who flew on which glider and what happened to each man – only the anecdotal evidence and individual stories I've managed to track down,"" he said. He has commissioned a memorial to ""remember all those who flew from Rivenhall and died on that day"". It will be unveiled at an event on 23 March, with military vehicles, static stands, re-enactors, presentations and a flypast by a Dakota. A memorial service will be held the next day at 07:00 GMT.

How Britain's former top banker became Canada's prime minister,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko,"The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013. He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job. But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in. Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories. With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship. The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. ""Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,"" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. ""These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times."" In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister. In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis. Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England. He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor. In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions. Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of ""forward guidance"", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%. Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an ""unreliable boyfriend"", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down. Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums. In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound. Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession. In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal. He described it as his ""toughest day"" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively. The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy. His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock ""should be temporary"". Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour. From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency. He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage. Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days. After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books. ""When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,"" Carney said. ""Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about."" He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs ""until the Americans show us respect … and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade"". The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea. ""Why don't I become a circus clown?"" he told a reporter in 2012. Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation. Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post. Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods. ""I know how to manage crises,"" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. ""In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills."" Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board. They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister. In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well. He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change. One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment. Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. ""This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,"" he said. On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed.The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun. His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - arecent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

"Military planning for Ukraine peace to begin, says Starmer",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ymrz8d21yo,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said military planning to protect a potential Ukraine ceasefire is moving to an ""operational phase"" after a virtual meeting with 29 other world leaders. Military leaders will meet in London on Thursday ""to put strong and robust plans in place to swing in behind a peace deal and guarantee Ukraine's future security"", Sir Keir said. The meeting follows Ukraine agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire after talks with the US. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he agrees with the idea, but set a number of pre-conditions for peace. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who joined Saturday's meeting, said ""active pressure is needed, not just talks"". ""The world must understand that Russia is the only obstacle preventing peace,"" he said. ""The path to peace must begin unconditionally. If Russia doesn't want this, then strong pressure must be applied until they do. Moscow understands one language,"" Zelensky added. He urged European countries to produce their own weapons as soon as possible and to talk to the US and its President Donald Trump to reach a deal more quickly through ""full sanctions, strong pressure, and forcing Russia to make peace"". In a speech after the video call, Sir Keir said ""the world needs actions...not empty words and conditions"". In a statement, he said the ""Kremlin's dithering and delay"" over the ceasefire proposal and its continued attacks on Ukraine ""run entirely counter to President Putin's stated desire for peace"". Leaders agreed on Saturday that if Putin refused an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire"" they would need to ""ratchet up pressure...to convince him to come to the negotiating table"", Sir Keir said. ""To deliver this, we will accelerate our military support, tighten our sanctions on Russia's revenues, and continue to explore all lawful routes to ensure that Russia pays for the damage it has done to Ukraine,"" the statement read. Putin said on Thursday he supported the idea of a ceasefire, but added ""there are nuances"" and asked a list of questions about details, including whether a ceasefire would allow Ukraine to rearm and who would police it. Participants in Saturday's call included Nato, the European Union, nearly two dozen European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Military chiefs will meet this week to move forward on ""practical plans"" for how their militaries can support Ukraine, Sir Keir said. ""We will build up Ukraine's own defences and armed forces, and be ready to deploy as a 'coalition of the willing' in the event of a peace deal, to help secure Ukraine on the land, at sea, and in the sky,"" his statement read. Sir Keir introduced the idea of a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend a ceasefire earlier this month, and on Saturday said it had grown and includes backing from Japan and others. The prime minister has previously said he is ""ready and willing"" to put UK troops in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. He has called on other European countries to commit to concrete security guarantees, and said a US ""backstop"" is needed. In a news conference after the summit, Zelensky said there was a need for some form of ""boots on the ground"" after the ceasefire, although he admitted some were ""sceptical"". Finnish President Alexander Stubb told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg after the summit that it is ""still too early"" to talk about putting troops on the ground as part of any security guarantee. Stubb said Finland was willing to be part of efforts to defend a peace deal, but said: ""It is too early to talk about boots on the ground because we don't have a ceasefire, we don't have a peace process. Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments."" He said there was ""anywhere from zero to 50 different ways they can help out, boots on the ground is only one way"".

'I was duped into leaving London for school in Ghana - but it saved me',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kg1ezyv5xo,"When my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.

In their defence, they told the judge they did not want to see their 14-year-old son become ""yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London"". Back in the mid-1990s, my mother, a primary school teacher, was motivated by similar concerns. I had been excluded from two high schools in the London Borough of Brent, hanging out with the wrong crowd (becoming the wrong crowd) - and heading down a dangerous path. My closest friends at the time ended up in prison for armed robbery. Had I stayed in London, I would have almost certainly been convicted with them. But being sent to Ghana also felt like a prison sentence. I can empathise to a degree with the teenager, who said in his court statement that he feels like he is ""living in hell"". Yet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realised what my mother had done had been a blessing. Unlike the boy at the centre of the London court case - which he lost - I did not go to boarding school in Ghana. My mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction. I first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra. The lifestyle change hit hard. In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence - even if I was using it recklessly. In Ghana, I was waking up at 05:00 to sweep the courtyard and wash my uncle's often muddy pick-up truck and my aunt's car. It was her vehicle that I would later steal - something of a watershed moment. I did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldier's Mercedes. I tried to flee the scene. But that soldier caught me and threatened to take me to Burma Camp, the notorious military base where people had disappeared in the past. That was the last truly reckless thing I did. It was not just discipline that I learnt in Ghana - it was perspective. Life in Ghana showed me how much I had taken for granted. Washing clothes by hand and preparing meals with my aunt made me appreciate the effort needed. Food, like everything in Ghana, required patience. There were no microwaves, no fast-food runs. Making the traditional dough-like dish fufu, for example, is laborious and involves pounding cooked yams or cassava into a paste with a mortar. At the time, it felt like punishment. Looking back, it was building resilience. Initially, my uncles considered placing me in high-end schools like the Ghana International School or SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College. But they were smart. They knew I might just form a new crew to cause chaos and mischief. Instead, I received private tuition at Accra Academy, a state secondary school that my late father had attended. It meant I was often taught on my own or in small groups. Lessons were in English, but out of school those around me were often speaking local languages and I found it easy to pick them up perhaps because it was such an immersive experience. Back home in London, I used to love to learn swear words in my mother's Fante language - but was far from fluent. When I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favourite uncle, Uncle Jojo - an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School. In contrast to the boy making the headlines in the UK, who claimed Ghana's education system was not up to standard, I found it to be exacting. I was considered academically gifted in the UK, despite my troublesome ways, but actually found it tough going in Ghana. Students my age were far ahead in subjects like maths and science. The rigour of the Ghanaian system pushed me to study harder than I ever had in London. The result? I earned five GCSEs with grades C and above - something that once seemed impossible. Beyond academic achievements, Ghanaian society instilled values that have stayed with me for life. Respect for elders was non-negotiable. Throughout the neighbourhoods I lived in, you greeted those older than you, regardless of whether or not you knew them. Ghana did not just make me more disciplined and respectful - it made me fearless. Football played a huge part in that transformation. I played in the parks, which were often hard red clay with loose pebbles and stones, with two square goalposts fashioned out of wood and string. It was a far cry from the neatly maintained pitches in England, but it toughened me up in ways I could not have imagined - and it is no wonder some of the greatest  footballers seen in the English Premier League have come from West Africa. The aggressive style played in Ghana was not just about skill - it was about resilience and endurance. Getting tackled on rough ground meant picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and carrying on. Every Sunday, I played football on the beach - though I would often be late because there was absolutely no way either of my uncles would allow me to stay home instead of attending church. Those services felt like they lasted forever. But it was also a testament to Ghana as a God-fearing nation, where faith is deeply embedded in everyday life. The first 18 months were the hardest. I resented the restrictions, the chores, the discipline. I even tried stealing my passport to fly back to London, but my mother was ahead of me and had hidden it well. There was no escape. My only choice was to adapt. Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing Ghana as a prison and started seeing it as happy home. I know of a few others like me who were sent back to Ghana by their parents living in London. Michael Adom was 17 when he arrived in Accra for school in the 1990s, describing his experience as ""bittersweet"". He stayed until he was 23 and now lives back in London working as a probation officer. His main complaint was the loneliness - he missed his family and friends. There were times of anger about his situation and the complications of feeling misunderstood. This largely stemmed from the fact that his parents had not taught him or his siblings any of the local languages when growing up in London. ""I didn't understand Ga. I didn't understand Twi. I didn't understand Pidgin,"" the 49-year-old tells me. This made him feel vulnerable for his first two-and-a-half years - and, he says, liable to being fleeced, for example, by those increasing prices because he seemed foreign. ""Anywhere I went, I had to make sure I went with somebody else,"" he says. But he ended up becoming fluent in Twi and, overall, he believes the positives outweighed the negatives: ""It made me a man. ""My Ghana experience matured me and changed me for the better, by helping me to identify with who I am, as a Ghanaian, and cemented my understanding of my culture, background and family history."" I can concur with this. By my third year, I had fallen in love with the culture and even stayed on for nearly two more years after passing my GCSEs. I developed a deep appreciation of the local food. Back in London, I never thought twice about what I was eating. But in Ghana, food was not just sustenance - each dish had its own story. I became obsessed with ""waakye"" - a dish made from rice and black-eyed peas, often cooked with millet leaves, giving it a distinctive purple-brown colour. It was usually served with fried plantain, the spicy black pepper sauce ""shito"", boiled eggs, and sometimes even spaghetti or fried fish. It was the ultimate comfort food. I enjoyed the music, the warmth of the people and the sense of community. I was not just ""stuck"" in Ghana any more - I was thriving. My mother, Patience Wilberforce, passed away recently, and with her loss I have reflected deeply on the decision she made all those years ago. She saved me. Had she not tricked me into staying in Ghana, the chances of me having a criminal record or even serving time in prison would have been extremely high. I went on to enrol at the College of North West London aged 20 to study media production and communications, before joining BBC Radio 1Xtra via a mentoring scheme. The guys I used to hang out with in north-west London did not get the second chance that I did. Ghana reshaped my mindset, my values and my future. It turned a misguided menace into a responsible man. While such an experience might not work for everyone, it gave me the education, discipline and respect I needed to reintegrate into society when I returned to England. And for that, I am forever indebted to my mother, to my uncles and to the country that saved me. Mark Wilberforce is a freelance journalist based in London and Accra.

At least 31 dead as tornadoes tear through southern US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevx7lkznm1o,"At least 31 people have died in the US - including 12 in Missouri alone - after deadly tornadoes tore through several south-eastern states, flipping cars and flattening homes. In Kansas, at least eight people died after more than 55 vehicles were involved in a crash due to a dust storm. More than 170,000 properties were without power across five states - including  Michigan Missouri and Illinois - on Saturday evening, according to tracker PowerOutage. Further severe weather is expected for the region, with tornado watches issued across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle. Flash flooding and flood warnings have also been issued in central Mississippi, eastern Louisiana and western Tennessee; as well as parts of Alabama and Arkansas, as severe weather continues to track across the south-east. The National Weather Service (NWS) has said these flash floods could prove deadly. Multiple tornado warnings were also issued across Alabama on Saturday night. The NWS warned of ""multiple intense to violent long-track tornadoes"" in those areas, describing the situation as ""particularly dangerous"". The meteorological agency said: ""If you live in these areas, get to the sturdiest structure you have access to and remain in place until the storms pass."" Mike Kehoe, governor of Missouri, said the state had been ""devastated by severe storms and tornadoes, leaving homes destroyed and lives lost"". Missouri's emergency management agency said initial reports indicated 19 tornadoes had struck 25 counties so far. Arkansas has seen three deaths and 29 injuries - prompting Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders to declare a state of emergency. Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, also declared a state of emergency, while Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt confirmed one person had been killed in the state. A dust storm that caused three deaths in Texas on Friday night caused a pile-up of an estimated 38 cars. ""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" Sgt Cindy Barkley, of the state's department of public safety, told reporters. ""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled."" A further death has since been reported in Texas. The destructive storms fuelled more than 100 wildfires in several central states and overturned multiple semi-trailer trucks, CBS reports. In Oklahoma, one of those fires, known as the 840 Road Fire, has already burned 27,500 acres and remains 0% contained, according to the Oklahoma Forestry Service. The agency has issued a ""red flag"" warning for the state's panhandle area, signalling a severe fire danger. Tornadoes form when moist, warm air rises, mixing with cold air above to form thunderclouds. Winds blowing from different directions cause the air to rotate, creating a vortex of air moving upwards. Four states where tornado-related deaths have been confirmed in the past day lie within a path frequently hit by the weather phenomenon. It has earned this stretch of the US the unofficial name Tornado Alley, because its geography is ideal for tornado formation. In 2024, 54 people were killed in tornado-related incidents,according to Noaa. Nine people died in Texas. There were eight in Oklahoma, five in Arkansas and one in Missouri. Peak tornado season in Tornado Alley is from May to June - but meteorologists caution that tornadoes can occur at any time of year. Have you been personally affected by the tornadoes in the US?

Hackman's children not named in actor's $80m will,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7985ld2lrro,"The will of legendary actor Gene Hackman has been released, but uncertainty lingers over his $80m (£62m) fortune. The two-time Academy Award winner left his entire estate to his wife of 30 years, Betsy Arakawa. But Arakawa, 65, was found dead alongside her husband in their New Mexico home last month. Legal experts have now said that, because authorities say Arakawa died seven days before her husband, Hackman's children could now potentially inherit his fortune, despite not being named in the will. His three children with his late ex-wife, Faye Maltese - Christopher, 65, Elizabeth, 62, and Leslie, 58 - have not commented publicly on the matter. Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting Legal documents obtained by the BBC show Hackman, 95, named Arakawa as his sole beneficiary in 1995, with the last update to the will in 2005. However, California attorney Tre Lovell told the BBC that the estate could default to them under succession laws, as long as there was no other beneficiary named. ""The estate will actually be probated in accordance with intestate succession laws and the children would be lawfully next in line to inherit,"" he said. They would also need to prove that the will is invalid because Arakawa died before Hackman, he added. Authorities say Arakawa passed awayon 11 February after contracting a rare virus,   days before Hackman died of natural causes. The couple was found dead in separate rooms of their $4m Santa Fe home on 26 February  after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window. Arakawa was found in the bathroom with pills scattered nearby, while Hackman was in the back of the house, wearing sweatpants and slippers, his cane and sunglasses beside him. Officials determined he died seven days after his wife due to severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's listed as a contributing factor. Authorities initially deemed the scene ""suspicious"" but later ruled out foul play. Arakawa's own will left her assets to Hackman, with a provision that if they died within 90 days of each other, her estate would go to a trust and later be donated to charity  after covering medical expenses. Hackman has in the past discussed his relationship with his children. ""You become very selfish as an actor,"" he told The New York Times in 1989. ""Even though I had a family, I took jobs that would separate us for three or four months at a time. The temptations in that, the money and recognition, it was too much for the poor boy in me."" Hackman's children, though rarely in the public eye, occasionally attended red carpet events with him. In another interview, Hackman talked about the difficulty his children had of growing up with a parent who was constantly in the spotlight. ""It's tough being the son or daughter of a celebrity,"" he told The Irish Independent in 2000.  ""I couldn't always be home with them when they were growing up, and then, living in California, they've had my success always hanging over their heads."" His daughters and granddaughter expressed deep affection for him after his passing. ""He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us, he was always just Dad and Grandpa,"" they said. ""We will miss him sorely, and are devastated by the loss."" The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks.

Democratic Party infighting exposes struggle to unite against Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr723zn40e5o,"On Friday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position. President Donald Trump was singing his praises. And former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other influential Democrats were expressing their dismay with him – or worse. This was Schumer's fate the day after he decided to back a Republican-crafted measure to avert a possible US government shutdown this weekend. Later, he followed through on his promise, voting with nine other Democrats and all but one Republican to overcome the key procedural hurdle that - if Democrats had stuck together in opposition - would have prevented  the funding bill from coming to a final vote. The Senate bill, which passed that final vote shortly after, contained a number of provisions that angered liberals. These included cuts to non-military programmes, increased spending on border security, limits on how Congress can rescind Trump's tariffs and draconian restrictions on Washington DC's budget. Schumer acknowledged all of this, but said he was backing the bill because a shutdown, which would allow the president to determine what government services and employees to suspend, would be worse. ""I believe it is the best way to minimise the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,"" he said on Friday. ""Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via government shutdown is a far worse option."" It didn't take long after Schumer's announcement for Democratic second guessing – and straight-up outrage – to ensue. ""Chuck Schumer is unwilling and unable to meet the moment,"" the Democratic group Pass the Torch, which led calls for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid last summer, said in a statement. Pelosi, who wields considerable influence among House Democrats despite having stepped down from her leadership position, decried what she said was a ""false choice"" between a shutdown and accepting the Republican measure. ""We must fight back in a better way,"" she said, suggesting a short-term funding extension and new bipartisan negotiations. She called the Republican bill a ""blank cheque that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America"". In a Friday press conference, the current House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, dodged questions about Schumer. When asked if he still had confidence in his Senate counterpart, he tersely replied: ""Next question."" Others in the party were less circumspect. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told reporters that he expected ""new leadership"" in the Senate next year – or after the next presidential election in 2028. A group of 60 House Democrats – who joined all but one in their party to vote against the Republican bill in that chamber – penned a letter to Schumer, saying that the legislation ""potentially legitimises President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government"". ""If Republicans in Congress want to pass this bill,"" they wrote, ""they should do so with their own votes."" As if to add rub salt on Democratic wounds, Trump took to his Truth Social website on Friday morning to praise what he said was a ""good and smart move"" by Schumer – and to promise that more Republican legislation on taxes, spending and ""so much more"" was coming. ""This could lead to something big for USA,"" he wrote, ""a whole new direction and beginning!"" While many rank-and-file Democrats and liberal activists clamoured for Schumer and Senate Democrats to block the House measure even if it triggered a government shutdown, it is unclear whether such a move would have pressured Trump and Republicans to negotiate a less partisan government-funding bill. In fact, there are many on the right, including Trump's designated government slasher, Elon Musk, who were relishing an opportunity to use a shutdown to further hamstring the federal bureaucracy. After days, or weeks, of shutdown pain that would disproportionately affect their supporters, the Democratic Party could have found itself in the same place it is now – with limited power and few good options. ""Neither House Democrats nor the people voting 'no' in the Senate nor the people getting mad on Twitter have an actual strategy for getting what the base wants out of this, which is some kind of act of Congress saying that Trump and Musk need to conduct the government differently,"" writes Matthew Yglesias, a left-leaning commentator. Democrats have the power to block Republican legislation, but they simply don't have the votes to advance their own alternative either in the House or the Senate. That doesn't make the situation Schumer and the Democrats have found themselves in any easier to stomach, however. Republicans, by sticking together, have been able to exert their will in Congress, while Trump pushes the boundaries of presidential power. Elections, as they say, have consequences. And 2024's results have left Democrats deep in the wilderness. The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification.

Non-essential helicopters banned from around Reagan airport after crash,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z6v8deryo,"The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has permanently restricted non-essential helicopter operations around Reagan National Airport following a deadly mid-air collision with an American Airlines regional jet in January. The change is an attempt to improve safety around the airport, which is just outside of the nation's capital in Washington DC. In January, a US Army Black Hawk helicopter with a crew of three collided with an American Airlines jet carrying 64 people. Both aircraft crashed near the airport. All 67 aboard were killed. The FAA's announcement followed the release of a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigating the crash. TheFAAalso announced on Friday it will eliminate helicopter and fixed-wing mixed traffic by the airport. It said it was evaluating other routes for helicopters, which are commonly used in Washington. The new restrictions will allow helicopters to only fly through the airport's airspace on urgent matters - such as for life-saving medical reasons, priority law enforcement or presidential transport - but it aims to keep them a distance away from airplanes, according to the agency. Additionally, runways 15 and 33, near where the doomed American Airlines flight was seconds away from landing, will also be blocked for aircrafts when helicopters are in the area. US air crash investigators earlier this week recommended restricting helicopter flights in certain areas near the airport. The FAA is also assessing other cities with chartered helicopter routes, including Boston, New York, Detroit, Dallas, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles. ""To make us more predictive, we are using machine learning and language modelling to scan incident reports and mine multiple data sources to find themes and areas of risk,"" according to a statement from the agency.

"'For holding a wombat, thousands threatened my life'",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2d1x4ykvgo,"A US influencer who was filmed taking a wild baby wombat away from its distressed mother in Australia has said she is ""truly sorry"" and received thousands of death threats over the incident. Sam Jones, who calls herself an ""outdoor enthusiast and hunter"", was filmed picking up the joey on the side of a road, while laughing and running over to a car, while the mother chases after them. It sparked a huge backlash, with Australian PM Anthony Albanese challenging her to ""take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there"". In a lengthy statementon her Instagram page, Jones says she was trying to get the animals safely off the road. She said, as can be seen in the video, that the mother runs off the road, but the baby does not, and Jones scoops it up. She says she ran across the road ""not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear she might attack me"". ""The snap judgement I made in these moments was never from a place of harm or stealing a joey,"" the statement said. She said the video was ""not staged, nor was it done for entertainment"", and in her excitement of the moment, ""acted too quickly and failed to provide necessary context to viewers online"". In the second part of her statement, Jones launched a scathing attack on Australia's animal culling laws, including wombats, kangaroos, horses, deer and pigs. Australia has various culling laws and regulations that spark controversy and divide the nation. Wombats, which are native to Australia, are a protected species, but permits can be obtained to cull them if deemed necessary. Anonline petition supporting her deportation received more than 40,000 signatures.Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said his department was reviewing whether it could revoke Jones's visa. However, the BBC understands that she left the country of her own accord. Jones, who also goes by the name Samantha Strable, has more than 95,000 followers on Instagram. Conservationists warned Jones's ""appalling"" behaviour could have caused severe harm to the wombats. The Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the ""mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'"". ""[She] then placed the vulnerable baby back onto a country road - potentially putting it at risk of becoming roadkill,"" it noted in its statement, adding that it remained unclear if the joey had been reunited with its mother. ""I caught a baby wombat,"" Jones said in the video, while the joey could be heard hissing and struggling in her grip. The man filming can be heard laughing: ""Look at the mother, it's chasing after her!"" Her caption in the now-deleted post read: ""My dream of holding a wombat has been realised! Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush."" ""The baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom,"" she wrote in the comments, responding to criticism. ""They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed. I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so."" Animal rights organisations have criticised Jones. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or Peta, described the video as ""wildlife-exploiting content"" and urged people to ""stop treating wildlife as a prop"".

'Terrifying and exhausting' - passengers describe escape from burning plane,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c241d1v0l65o,"""Nerve-wrecking, terrifying and horrific."" That is how one witness described her experience getting off an American Airlines flight that caught fire after it was forced to make an emergency landing in Colorado. Some of the 172 passengers travelling on the flight bound for Dallas were seen standing on the plane's wing after it touched down in Denver, with large plumes of smoke encircling around them. Everyone on board, including six crew members, made it out of the plane alive, with 12 passengers treated at hospital for minor injuries, according to airport officials. One of those passengers, Michele Woods, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, how everything about the flight seemed normal at take off. It was not until they were cruising in the air that she noticed a loud noise reverberating from one of the plane's engines. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later confirmed the plane diverted to Denver at around 17:15 local time (23:15 GMT) after the crew reported ""engine vibrations"". But even when the plane landed, passengers soon realised they were still far from safety. ""Everything was fine but then there was smoke filling the cabin,"" said Ms Woods, who was returning home after attending a trade show in Colorado. Seated at the front of the plane, she explained how she was one of the few in a position where they were able to walk off the plane once it had touched down. Other passengers, asnow viral imagesof huddled people standing on the wing of a smoking plane show, did not have as straightforward an escape. Ingrid Hibbit, who was travelling on flight 1006 with her husband and daughter, was one of the unfortunate few forced out onto the wing before she could reconnect with her family on the ground. ""[You could see] flames from the window and the windows [were] kind of melting,"" Ms Hibbit told CBS. Dismounting from the plane proved to be a difficult task - not helped, she pointed out, by being dressed in Birkenstock sandals. ""I was like shaking, I was not stable,"" she admitted. Adding to her already fever-pitch anxieties was the fact neither she, nor any member of her family, were seated in the same section of the plane. They could communicate only through text messages. ""I was hoping everything was okay, but we really didn't know for sure,"" she said, adding that despite the ordeal lasting only 10 minutes, ""it was a very long 10 minutes"". ""It was a really great feeling to see that everyone was okay."" She and her family finally touched down at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Friday morning, along with several of the other passengers. Relief, she said, had swept through the group, particularly after an ""exhausting"" episode that had overshadowed the start of their family holiday. ""If this would've happened in the air, I don't think we would be telling this story at all, because who knows what that would've been like,"" she said. ""I'm grateful that everyone survived."" The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks.

Greenland's opposition wins election dominated by independence and Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r3d0r8z0o,"Greenland's centre-right opposition has won a surprise general election victory - in a vote dominated by independence and US President Donald Trump's pledge to take over the semi-autonomous territory. The Democratic party, which favours a gradual approach to independence from Denmark - achieved around 30% of the vote, near-complete results show. ""Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside,"" party leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen told local media. ""There is a need for unity, so we will enter into negotiations with everyone."" His party will now have to negotiate with other parties in order to form a coalition. Greenland - the world's biggest island, between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years. Greenland governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. Five of the six main parties in the election favour independence from Copenhagen, but disagree over the pace with which to reach it. The Democratic party, whose vote was up by more than 20% on 2021, is considered a moderate party on independence. Another opposition party, Naleraq, which is looking to immediately kick off the independence process and forge closer ties with the US, is on course for second place with almost a quarter of the vote. Support for Naleraq was boosted ahead of the vote by the decision of one of Greenland's most popular young politicians, Aki-Matilda Hoegh-Dam, to switch from one of the ruling parties. She came second only to Democrats leader Jens Frederik Nielsen in the popular vote. ""It's the second biggest party, so you can't avoid them,"" Nielsen told local reporters. ""But we don't want to rule out the other parties beforehand."" The two current governing parties, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) and Siumut, are heading for  third and fourth place - marking an upset for Prime Minister Mute B Egede. More than 40,000 Greenlanders out of a population of 57,000 were eligible to cast their votes to elect 31 MPs, as well as the local government. Six parties were on the ballot. The voting took place at 72 polling stations scattered across the vast island. ""The Democrats need a supporting partner to be able to have a majority,"" says Maria Ackren from the University of Greenland. ""It would say it can be either Naleraq or Inuit Ataqatigiit. It's up to the Democrats to try to figure out what they want."" Since 2009 Greenland has had the right to call an independence referendum. Although Naleraq is pushing for a vote within a few years, Jens-Frederik Nielsen's party favours a gradual approach towards independence, focusing first on making self-government a success. Prof Ackren believes the Democrats won, partly because Greenlanders wanted a change of government, but also because they were unhappy with new fisheries laws and other domestic issues. Independence is seen as the end goal for most Greenlanders, but not before reforms have been made to the economy, health and other sectors, she says. Greenland's strategic location and untapped mineral resources have caught President Trump's eye in particular. He first floated the idea of buying the island during his first term in 2019. Since taking office again in January, Trump has reiterated his intention to acquire the territory. ""We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're gonna get it,"" he said during his address to the US Congress last week. Greenland and Denmark's leaders have repeatedly rebuffed his demands. The leader of the Democrats said Greenland needed to adopt a calm course with the US. He told public broadcaster KNR that while big developments were happening globally, they should stand together and speak with one voice. The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks. A judge ordered a 14-day halt on deporting Venezuelans under a Trump order that declared them enemies. Campaigners in St Louis want support for those who claim to have become ill due to research into the atomic bomb.

Musk's Tesla raises concern over Trump tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201z4lv5xxo,"Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla has warned it and other US exporters could be harmed by countries retaliating to Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Mr Musk is a close ally of the US president and is leading efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. But in an unsigned letter addressed to the US trade representative, Tesla said while it ""supports"" fair trade it was concerned US exporters were ""exposed to disproportionate impacts"" if other countries retaliated to tariffs. The letter was dated the same day thatTrump hosted an event at the White Housewhere he promised to buy a Tesla in a show of support for Mr Musk. It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter as it is unsigned, or if Mr Musk was aware of it. Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year. In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets. ""None the less,"" it warned, ""even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US."" The US president has imposed an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory levies including on cars. China is Tesla's second biggest market after the US. ""For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries,"" the letter reads. The EU and Canada have both threatened sweeping retaliations for tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, which went into effect earlier this week. Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Mr Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration, where he is head of the  Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Earlier this week,Trump hosted an event at the White Housewhere he said people protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, while sitting in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy. Trump said demonstrators were ""harming a great American company"", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would ""go through hell"". The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a ""green new scam"" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector Car sharing has not taken off, but will electric cars boost its appeal? The  deputy first minister has said she engages ""with the office of president"" rather than his ""particular personal views"". Wine and spirits will be taxed, Trump says, if the EU does not remove tariffs on US whiskey. The tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could not come at a worse time, says the steel industry body.

Trump pledges to match EU and Canada's retaliatory tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e4d8epdzdo,"US President Donald Trump has pledged to impose more tariffs after his latest move to introduce import taxes on steel and aluminium entering the US prompted retaliation from the European Union (EU) and Canada. Trump said that ""of course"" he would respond to the countermeasures, repeating his warning to reveal ""reciprocal"" tariffs next month on countries around the world. ""Whatever they charge us with, we're charging them,"" he said. The threat marked a further escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets amid concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US. On Wednesday, Trump moved forward with a plan to widen US tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposing a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries. That followed an order earlier this month that raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%. Trump has also threatened tariffs - which are taxes applied to goods as they enter a country - on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars. Leaders in Canada and Europe called the new metals taxesunjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. Other countries that are key US suppliers of metals, including the UK, Australia, Mexico and Brazil, held off on any immediate retaliation. ""Like everybody else, I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium but we will take a pragmatic approach,"" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. ""We are...negotiating a deal which covers and includes tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table."" Canada said from Thursday it would start charging a 25% tax on nearly C$30bn ($20bn; £16bn) worth of US products, including steel, computers and sports equipment. Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney said he wasready to negotiate a renewed trade deal with Trump, as long as there was ""respect for Canadian sovereignty"". The EU said it would raise its levies on up to €26bn ($28bn; £22bn) worth of US goods, including boats, bourbon and motorbikes, from 1 April. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the response was intended to be ""strong but proportionate"" and added that the EU stood ""ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue"". ""Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and worse for consumers,"" she said, warning the economic disruption put jobs at stake and would send prices higher. ""Nobody needs that – on both sides, neither in the European Union nor in the United States."" Trump had said he wants to boost US steel and aluminium production in the longer run, but critics say in the immediate term the taxes on imports of the metals will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth. Major packaged food makers including Quaker Oats and Folgers coffee asked Trump for targeted exemptions from tariffs on imports such as cocoa and fruit, according to a letter seen by Reuters. PepsiCo, Conagra and J M Smucker, also requested the president exempt ingredients not available from US sources in the letter, which was sent by the trade group the Consumer Brands Association. Coffee, oats, cocoa, spices, tropical fruit and tin mill steel, used for some food and household goods, are among the imports listed as unavailable domestically, Reuters reported. The import taxes are also expected to reduce demand for steel and aluminium that is not made in the US - a blow to makers of the metals elsewhere. The EU estimated that the latest US tariffs affect about 5% of its total exports to the US, while the US is the destination for roughly 90% of Canada's steel and aluminium exports. Shares in the US were mixed on Wednesday, after two days of sharp decline. The Dow closed down 0.2%, while the S&P 500 ended nearly 0.5% higher and the Nasdaq jumped 1.2%. In an appearance at the White House with the Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Trump said he did not plan to back down from his trade fight, saying he was ""not happy"" with EU trade policies. He cited concerns about legal penalties it has imposed on Apple and rules he claimed put US farm products and cars at a disadvantage. ""They're doing what they should be doing perhaps for the European Union but it does create ill will,"" he said. Repeating his threat to hit European cars with tariffs, he added later: ""We're going to win that financial battle."" Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists fear they could spark a trade war. How much will the UK be hit by US tariffs and what happens next? Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US. Donald Trump's plans for tariffs risk raising prices for items from cars to canned food. The White House sees levies as a means to reshape America's relationship with its global partners. Copyright 2025 BBC.

US government shutdown averted as Senate passes spending bill,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vzjrm5lm8o,"The US has averted a government shutdown after the Senate passed a Republican-led measure to keep the government funded for the next six months. The stopgap funding bill passed in the Senate 54-46, as two Democrats joined all but one Republican senator in voting yes. President Donald Trump had signed it into law, a White House spokesman said on Saturday. The key vote came earlier when some Senate Democrats, after fierce debate, allowed the measure to pass a procedural hurdle. The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, and nine others broke with their colleagues to vote to advance the bill to its final Friday evening vote. Two Democrats -  Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Independent Senator Angus King of Maine - voted in favour of its final passage. Schumer voted ""no"". On Thursday, he announced he would vote to allow the measure to move forward, saying although it wasn't a bill he liked, he believed triggering a shutdown would be a worse result. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez called Schumer's willingness to let the spending bill proceed a ""huge slap in the face"", adding that there is a ""wide sense of betrayal"" among the party, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. She said supporting the bill ""codifies the chaos and the reckless cuts that Elon Musk has been pursuing"", and that Senate Democrats who voted yes would be empowering ""the robbing of our federal government in order to finance tax cuts for billionaires"". The Democrats had agonised over whether to support the measure, and eventually pushed for a 30-day continuing resolution that was unlikely to earn enough support to pass. Senator Ted Cruz accused the Democrats of conducting ""political theater"" and praised the bill's passage. ""The government is funded, let's get back to work,"" he said in a statement. The passage is a victory for Trump and congressional Republicans. On Friday morning, Trump offered rare bipartisan praise of Schumer's decision to let the bill advance, writing that ""a non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights"". The legislation would keep much of the federal funding levels from the Biden Administration in place, with some key changes. It increases military spending by $6bn (£4.6bn), for items like border security, veterans healthcare, and military spending. But would cut non-defence funding by about $13bn. Local officials in Washington DC had feared the bill would result in a $1bn cut in federal funds for the city over the next six months. However, the Senate approved a separate bill that kept its current operating budget intact, the New York Times reported. The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification. The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks.

"US had productive talks with Putin over Ukraine war, Trump says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce34g2e75zno,"US President Donald Trump has praised talks held with Russian President Vladimir Putin on theUS-proposed ceasefire dealin Ukraine as ""good and productive"". This comes after Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff met in Moscow on Thursday evening, after which the Kremlin said it shared the US's ""cautious optimism"" over a peace process. Trump said in a Truth Social post that the talks provided ""a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, accused Putin of trying to drag out talks to continue the war, while Sir Keir Starmer said the Russian president could not be allowed to ""play games"" with ceasefire proposals. Earlier this week, Ukraine accepted the US-proposed ceasefire deal, which Russia is yet to agree to. On Thursday, Putin had said the idea of a ceasefire was ""right and we support it... but there are nuances"" and he set out a number of tough conditions for peace, a response branded ""manipulative"" by Zelensky. Ukraine's leader continued his criticism on Friday in a series of posts on X, writing: ""Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing. ""That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire."" He said Putin would ""drag"" everyone into ""endless discussions... wasting days, weeks, and months on meaningless talks while his guns continue to kill people"". ""Every condition Putin puts forward is just an attempt to block any diplomacy. This is how Russia works. And we warned about this."" UK PM Sir Keir said the Kremlin's ""complete disregard"" for Trump's ceasefire proposal demonstrated Putin was ""not serious about peace"". ""If Russia finally comes to the table, then we must be ready to monitor a ceasefire to ensure it is a serious and enduring peace,"" he said. ""If they don't, then we need to strain every sinew to ramp up economic pressure on Russia to secure an end to this war."" On Saturday, Sir Keir will host a video call with as many as 25 leaders to develop the peacekeeping mission proposed during a summit in London earlier this month. The""coalition of the willing""- as he called it - will work to deter future Russian aggression, should the US-proposed ceasefire come into effect. In his social media posts on Friday, Zelensky ""strongly"" urged ""everyone who can influence Russia, especially the United States, to take strong steps that can help"", because Putin would not stop the war on his own. ""Putin is lying about the real situation on the battlefield... the casualties"" and ""the true state of his economy"", he said, explaining that Putin was ""doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails"". Butthe White House believes the two sides have ""never been this close to peace"". Talking to reporters, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt maintained that the talks between Putin and Witkoff in Moscow on Thursday were ""productive"". She added Trump has been ""putting pressure on Putin and the Russians to do the right thing"". Trump's social media post also ""strongly requested"" Putin should spare the lives of Ukrainian troops, whom he described as surrounded by Russian forces, adding it would be a ""horrible massacre"" not seen since World War Two. His comments came after Putin said on Thursday that Ukrainian troops in Kursk had been ""isolated"" and were trying to leave, as Russia ramps up efforts to reclaim the region invaded by Ukraine last year. But on Friday, Ukraine's armed forces general staff denied the encirclement of its troops, calling it ""false and fabricated"". In a statement, it said operations were continuing, with Ukrainian troops having withdrawn and ""successfully regrouped"" to better defensive positions. ""There is no threat of encirclement of our units,"" it said. In response to Trump's request, Putin said Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk would be treated with ""dignity in line with the norms of international law and the laws of the Russian Federation"" if they gave up arms and surrendered. Meanwhile, G7 members have been meeting in Quebec, where host Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said all the members agreed with the US proposal of a ceasefire that is supported by Ukrainians. ""And we are now studying and looking at Russian reactions, so ultimately the ball is now in Russia's court when it comes to Ukraine."" UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who was also at the meeting, said the members were united in calling for a ceasefire with ""no conditions"". Following the meeting, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would not make foreign policy decisions based on what leaders said on social media or at a news conference, and stressed the ""only way to end this war is through a process of negotiations"". The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification. The annual festivities in Washington DC can be more akin to a marathon, as Mark Carruthers explains. The Army-run cemetery said it is working to follow Trump's orders on ending diversity while restoring information.

Arlington Cemetery strips content on black and female veterans from website,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03gjnxe25o,"Arlington National Cemetery has scrubbed from its website information and educational materials about the history of black and female service members. Some of the content unpublished from the site was on veterans who had received the nation's highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, according to military news site Task & Purpose. The content removal is part of a larger effort by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the military and throughout the federal government. Approximately 400,000 veterans are buried in the Army-run cemetery, which was established after the US Civil War at the home of the South's general, Robert E. Lee. On the cemetery's website, internal links that directed users to webpages with information about the ""Notable Graves"" of dozens of black, Hispanic and female veterans were missing on Friday. The pages contained short biographies about veterans such as Gen Colin L Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the highest rank in the military after the president. They also told the life stories of members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military airmen. Earlier this year, the Defense Department had to reinstate training materials on the revered airmen after a national outcry over their removal following Trump's orders on DEI. Information on Hector Santa Anna, a World War II bomber pilot and career military leader who has been called a hero of the war, has been taken down, as well. Visitors to the site may also have trouble finding information, as links to major sections have disappeared. It no longer lists pages for African American History, Hispanic American History and Women's History. Content still exists on some notable women buried there, including former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 14 veterans from the unit recently featured in the Oscar-nominated movie The Six Triple Eight, but it is only found from a direct search. Since re-entering the White House, President Donald Trump has signed multiple executive orders banning DEI within the federal government. A spokesperson for the cemetery said in a statement it was working to restore links and content and remained ""committed to sharing the stories of military service and sacrifice to the nation"", according to the Washington Post. It added that it wanted to ensure that the content aligned with Trump's orders and also with instructions from Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the content removal. ""The whole thing is deeply concerning,"" Smith said in an interview with the New York Times. ""Even if you have concerns about the way DEI was handled in a number of different places, I've never seen a problem within the military."" Trump has made dramatic changes in the military in his second term, including firing the country's top general, CQ Brown, a black man who had supported diversity in the armed forces. Secretary Hegseth - a former Fox News host and military veteran - has pledged to root out all diversity initiatives and had accused Gen Brown of being ""woke"". There are 2.03m people serving in the US military on active duty or in reserves, with 30% identifying as part of a minority group such as black or Native American and 18% as Hispanic or Latino, according to the latest Defense Department report. One-fifth of those in the military are women. The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification.

US launches wave of air strikes on Yemen's Houthis,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05mvr3j3yro,"The US has launched a ""decisive and powerful"" wave of air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump has said, citing the armed group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as the reason. ""Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,"" Trump wrote on his Truth social platform, adding that their ""piracy, violence, and terrorism"" had cost ""billions of dollars"" and put lives at risk. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least 15 people were killed and nine others injured in the strikes. The group - which began targeting shipping in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza - said its forces would respond to US strikes. The Houthis reported a series of explosions on Saturday evening in Sanaa and in the northern province of Saada - the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally-recognised government. Unverified images show plumes of black smoke over the area of Sanaa's airport - which includes a military facility. In a statement, the Houthis blamed the US and the UK for ""wicked"" aggression targeting residential areas in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa - though it is understood that the UK did not participate in Saturday's US strikes against the Houthi targets but it did provide routine refuelling support for the US. These attacks, Trump said, ""will not be tolerated"". He added: ""We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective."" Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US government had ""no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy"". ""End support for Israeli genocide and terrorism,"" he posted on X on Sunday. ""Stop killing of Yemeni people."" The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members. The group has not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels, or by multiple rounds of US and British air strikes on its military targets. Israel has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since July in retaliation for the 400 missiles and drones that the Israeli military said had been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which were shot down. Major shipping companies have been forced to stop using the Red Sea - through which almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes - and use a much longer route around southern Africa instead. Trump said that it had been more than a year since a US-flagged ship had sailed safely through the Suez Canal - which the Red Sea leads to - and four months since a US warship had been through the body of water between east Africa and the Arabian peninsula. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe, and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Addressing the Houthis directly, Trump wrote that if they did not stop, ""HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE"". But the Houthis were unwavering in their response, saying the aggression would not wane their support for Palestinians. ""This aggression will not go without response and our Yemeni armed forces are ready to answer escalation with further escalation,"" the group said. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the Houthi's ""benefactor"", Iran, was ""on notice"". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also discussed military deterrence operations against the Houthis when he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday. Rubio emphasised that ""continued Houthi attacks on US military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated"", a State Department spokesperson said. The Houthis launched 190 attacks in the Red Sea between November 2023 and October 2024, according to the US Congress. Previously, the UK and US conducted joint naval andair strikes against the group. Israel has also targeted sites linked to the Houthis in separate strikes. Trump urged Iran to cease its support for the Houthis, warning that Washington would hold Tehran ""fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it"". He also accused the previous White House administration, under Joe Biden, of being ""pathetically weak"" and allowing the ""unrestrained Houthis"" to keep going. The annual festivities in Washington DC can be more akin to a marathon, as Mark Carruthers explains. The Army-run cemetery said it is working to follow Trump's orders on ending diversity while restoring information.

Starmer's ad hoc alliance could still struggle to materialise,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzgr5xgv6o,"UK Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer says a ""huge amount"" has happened since his ""coalition of the willing"" idea first surfaced at his Lancaster House summit a fortnight ago. He is not wrong: US-Ukrainian relations have been on a rollercoaster since then, culminating in the meeting in Riyadh earlier this week, where the two sides agreed on a 30-day ceasefire. But Sir Keir's coalition is a big, still somewhat nebulous undertaking, and there is clearly a great deal of work to be done before this ad hoc alliance is ready to take on something as complex – and potentially perilous – as keeping the peace in Ukraine. Sir Keir says the coalition is now bigger and that ""new commitments"" are on the table, though he did not spell these out. Participants of Saturday morning's virtual summit, he said, had agreed to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine and tighten restrictions on the Russian economy, to weaken Russian PresidentVladimir Putin's war machine. Planning, he said, would now move to an ""operational phase"", with military chiefs due to meet in the UK next Thursday. ""Overall, we are successfully gathering political and military momentum,"" he said. It is likely that we will see a rolling set of political, diplomatic and military gatherings as the plan slowly takes shape. It is far from plain sailing. Asked about vital US military support for any European-led operation – what's being called a ""backstop"" – the prime minister was clear: the US position had not changed. European national security advisors including Jonathan Powell – one of those credited with convincing Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept the US ceasefire proposal –  were in Washington on Friday. Unless US PresidentDonald Trump's position on the backstop changes, Sir Keir's coalition of the willing could struggle to get off the ground. For Zelensky, the military clock is ticking, especially in Kursk, where his troops have beenoccupying a shrinking sliver of Russian territory since August 2024. Ukraine vehemently denies reports that its forces are surrounded in Kursk – a theory promoted by Trump on Friday – but they are clearly under enormous pressure and are losing ground. When I was in Kyiv towards the end of last year, Ukrainian troops told us they were holding onto territory in Kursk as a bargaining chip to be played in future negotiations. But as those negotiations approach, it is a chip thatPutin seems determined to remove from the table first. That may go some way towards explaining his ""yes, but"" approach to the idea of a 30-day ceasefire. A twinning partnership between Malvern and war-torn Korosten builds support and understanding. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accuses Russia of dragging out ceasefire talks so it can continue the war. Trump wants a fast end to the fighting, but Putin wants a ""painstaking"" discussion about details.

"South African ambassador 'no longer welcome' in US, Rubio says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmj8ky3rvno,"The US is expelling South Africa's ambassador to Washington, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing him as a ""race-baiting politician"". In a post on X, Rubio accused Ebrahim Rasool of hating the US and President Donald Trump, and said the ambassador was ""no longer welcome in our great country"". The office for South Africa's president on Saturday called the decision ""regrettable"", adding that the country remained committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the US. The rare move by the US marks the latest development in rising tensions between the two countries. While lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, it's highly unusual in the US for it to happen to a more senior official. In his post on Friday, Rubio linked to an article from the right-wing outlet Breitbart that quoted some of Rasool's recent remarks made during an online lecture about the Trump administration. At the event, Rasool said Trump was ""mobilising a supremacism"" and trying to ""project white victimhood as a dog whistle"" as the white population faced becoming a minority in the US. ""We see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the Maga movement as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white,"" he said. He suggested that South Africa was under attack because ""we are the historical antidote to supremacism"". In response, Rubio called Rasool ""PERSONA NON GRATA"", referencing the Latin phrase for ""unwelcome person"". Ties between the US and South Africa have been deteriorating since Trump took office. An executive order last month - which froze US assistance to South Africa - cited ""unjust racial discrimination"" against white Afrikaners, largely descended from Dutch settlers who first arrived in the 17th Century. It references a new law, the Expropriation Act, that it claims targets Afrikaners by allowing the government to take away private land. ""As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavoured minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,"" a statement from the White House said at the time. South Africa's 2022 census noted that white people - including Afrikaners - made up 7.2% of the population. However, according to a 2018 land audit by the South African government, white farmers owned 72% of the country's individually-held farmland. South Africa's government, which is made up of 10 parties led by the African National Congress (ANC), said earlier that the US president's actions were based on ""a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation"". It added no land had been seized without compensation and said this would only happen in exceptional circumstances, such as if land was needed for public use and all other avenues to acquire the land had been exhausted. A fact sheet from the White House states the country ""blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority descendants of settler groups"". Rasool - who previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015 - was himself forcibly removed from his home in Cape Town's District Six as a child after it was declared a white area under the Apartheid government. He would later describe the eviction as a significant moment in his upbringing which guided his future. Rasool became Pretoria's ambassador to the US again in 2024. Unnamed sources in the South African government told online news site Daily Maverick at the time that he was thought to be well placed to deal with a Trump administration because of the experience and contacts he had acquired during his first stint as ambassador.

Iran using drones and apps to enforce women's dress code,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kg15jkpdeo,"Iran is using drones and intrusive digital technology to crush dissent, especially among women who refuse to obey the Islamic republic's strict dress code, the United Nations has said. Investigators say Iranian security officials are using a strategy of ""state-sponsored vigilantism"" to encourage people to use specialist phone apps to report women for alleged dress code violations in private vehicles such as taxis and ambulances. Their new report also highlights the increasing use of drones and security cameras to monitor hijab compliance in Tehran and in southern Iran. For women who defy the laws, or protest against them, the consequences are severe – arrest, beating, and even rape in custody. The findingsof the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracywas responsible for the ""physical violence"" that led to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in 2022. Witnesses said the 22-year-old Kurd was badly beaten by the morality police during her arrest, but authorities denied she was mistreated and blamed ""sudden heart failure"" for her death. Her killing sparked a massive wave of protests that continues today, despite threats of violent arrest and imprisonment. ""Two-and-a-half years after the protests began in September 2022, women and girls in Iran continue to face systematic discrimination, in law and in practice, that permeates all aspects of their lives, particularly with respect to the enforcement of the mandatory hijab,"" the report said. ""The state is increasingly reliant on state-sponsored vigilantism in an apparent effort to enlist businesses and private individuals in hijab compliance, portraying it as a civic responsibility."" At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities installed facial recognition software at its entrance gate to also find women not wearing the hijab, the report said. Surveillance camerason Iran's major roads are also being used to search for uncovered women. Investigators also said they obtained the ""Nazer"" mobile phone app offered by Iranian police, which allows ""vetted"" members of the public and the police to report on uncovered women in vehicles, including ambulances, buses, metro cars and taxis. ""Users may add the location, date, time and the licence plate number of the vehicle in which the alleged mandatory hijab infraction occurred, which then 'flags' the vehicle online, alerting the police,"" the report said. According to the report, a text message is then sent to the registered owner of the vehicle, warning them they had been found in violation of the mandatory hijab laws. Vehicles could be impounded for ignoring the warnings, it added. The UN investigators interviewed almost 300 victims and witnesses – they also looked in-depth at Iran's judicial system, which they said lacks any real independence. Victims of torture and other violations were also persecuted while their families were ""systematically intimidated"", according to their report. They also found evidence of the extrajudicial executions of three child and three adult protesters, later dismissed by the state as suicides. The report also established additional cases of sexual violence in custody, citing the case of one arrested woman who was beaten severely, subjected to two mock executions, raped and then gang-raped.

Mark Carney sworn in as first new Canadian prime minister in nine years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm1lg3gj7vo,"Mark Carney, an economist and political newcomer, has been sworn in as Canada's new prime minister, and delivered remarks vowing to ""never"" become a part of the United States. He took office on Friday just days after being elected leader of the governing Liberal Party and amid an ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump. ""We know that by building together, we can give ourselves far more than anyone else can take away,"" he said after the ceremony. Carney replaces outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in office for nine years, after a landslide victory in last week's Liberal leadership race. ""We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,"" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Friday, referring to Trump's musings that Canada join the US as its ""51st state"". ""We are very fundamentally a different country,"" he said, later adding the notion is ""crazy"". He declined to answer questions about the timing of Canada's next federal election - currently scheduled for October - but hinted he would move quickly to seek ""as strong a mandate that is needed for the time"". In his first order as prime minister, Carney moved to end a policy that had been frequent attacked against by political opponents. He ended the consumer carbon pricing programme - a key environmental policy under Trudeau that had become deeply unpopular in recent years amid high inflation. Conservatives have criticised the tax, saying it raised the price of goods and energy for Canadian families. At an afternoon cabinet meeting, Carney said his government will still take steps to fight climate change. An industrial carbon tax on large emitters remains in place. Canadians receive a rebate to offset the cost of carbon pricing and will get their final cheque in April. Canadian politics in recent months have largely been overshadowed by the trade war Trump launched after taking office in January - and with a general election on the horizon, Carney is expected to pitch himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Trump. He previously held roles as governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, and of the Bank of England, and helped both countries weather major financial disruption. He intends to travel to the UK and France as his first foreign trip as PM next week. Carney said he also looks forward to speaking with Trump. ""We respect the United States. We respect President Trump,"" he said. ""President Trump is has put some very important issues at the top of his agenda."" Carney has promised to uphold Canada's reciprocal tariffs on specific American goods for as long as Trump maintains 25% universal tariffs on Canadian goods not  covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) trade deal. Canada is dependent on trade with the US. Economists say it risks a recession if Trump's tariffs are fully imposed. Several of Carney's new cabinet members served under Trudeau, and in particular he kept on those who have been working directly with the Trump administration in recent months. They including Mélanie Joly, who remains in foreign affairs; David McGuinty, who remains in public safety; Jonathan Wilkinson, staying on as energy minister; Dominic Leblanc, who has moved from finance to trade; and François-Philippe Champagne, moved from industry to finance. When the federal election comes, Carney's main rival will be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Before the the threat of tariffs, Conservatives enjoyed a 20-point lead in some election polls. Now polls are indicating a much closer race. Speaking after Carney on Friday, Poilievre argued that Liberals do not deserve a fourth term in office, arguing adding they have already had nine years to improve affordability and other issues in the country. ""It will be the same Liberal results,"" he said. Poilievre added that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would ""face off against President Trump directly, respond with counter tariffs and take back control"". When Canadians next go to the polls, the Liberals will face not only the Conservatives - who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons - but also the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats, and the New Democrats (NDP), who have 24. Reacting to Carney's swearing in, the leader of the NDP argued that his cabinet appointments show that there is no room for progressive Liberals under his leadership. Jagmeet Singh said that he had failed to create separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities, and described Carney as someone who has made billionaires ""very rich at the cost of workers"". The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification. The annual festivities in Washington DC can be more akin to a marathon, as Mark Carruthers explains. The Army-run cemetery said it is working to follow Trump's orders on ending diversity while restoring information. The US Secretary of State called the ambassador a ""race-baiting politician who hates America"". The passage of the funding bill came hours before a shutdown, with Democrats under fierce pressure to oppose the measure. Copyright 2025 BBC.

They had a fairytale American childhood - but was radiation slowly killing them?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e7011n03vo,"After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital’s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old. ""Doctors were shocked,"" she says. ""We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs."" Kim’s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. Zack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old. Years later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek. In this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. A compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. This Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (£2bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024. Among the areas covered were parts of New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure. St Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area. Decades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: ""The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure."" The clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038. A new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump. When Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling. ""My husband didn’t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we’re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',"" she says. Just streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek. ""I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,"" says Karen. ""Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night."" But years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different. ""Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,"" she says. ""We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can’t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this."" When Karen’s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen’s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary. Karen helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area. ""We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,"" she says. ""These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases."" Teresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases. Years later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up. That does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected. ""ALS took my sister at 50,"" Teresa says. ""I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she’d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it."" Like Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring. Expanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer. In a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste. The BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment. ""My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She’d be the first to picket,"" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government. The trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals. Dr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a ""statistical thing"", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers. Now, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek. ""I tell them that there’s a potential that there’s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier."" He hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area. Other experts take a different view of the risks. ""There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades"", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University. ""But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited."" Prof Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards. For many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste. ""It’s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,” says Kim Visintine. “There’s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it’s just a matter of time."" A judge ordered a 14-day halt on deporting Venezuelans under a Trump order that declared them enemies. At least 20 people have died after tornadoes and severe storms tore through central and southern states. Natalie Harrop says there's ""nothing to lose"" in saving babies' stem cells for future health needs.

'Do you have communist links?' US sends 36 questions to UN aid groups,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70enzddxywo,"United Nations aid agencies have been sent questionnaires by the US asking them to state if they have ""anti-American"" beliefs or affiliations. Among the 36 questions on the form, sent by the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and seen by the BBC, is one asking if they have any links to communism. Some of the world's biggest humanitarian organisations have received the questionnaire, including the UN Refugee Agency and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Trump administration has launched a cost-cutting drive across the US government, led by billionaire Elon Musk, and has closed down much of its foreign aid. The UN groups fear the move by the OMB is a sign the US is planning to abandon humanitarian work - or even the UN itself - altogether. The US pulled out of the World Health Organization on the first day of US President Donald Trump's second term. And this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the vast majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes had been terminated. Surveys indicate thatmost Americans believe the country overspendson foreign aid. The US spends a lower percentage of its GDP on aid than European countries but, because of its huge economy, still supplies 40% of global humanitarian funding Many of the UN aid agencies who were sent the form receive funding, not just from USAID, but directly from the US government. One question asks: ''Can you confirm that your organisation does not work with entities associated with communist, socialist, or totalitarian parties, or any party that espouses anti-American beliefs?"" Another asks agencies to confirm they don't receive any funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran - these countries may not be Washington's best friends but, like all 193 UN member states, they fund the big humanitarian agencies. Other questions ask aid agencies to ensure no project includes any elements of DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) or anything related to climate change. This could be awkward for agencies like Unicef, which supports equal access to education for girls, or the World Food Programme, which tries to prevent famine by supporting drought affected communities to transition to more climate resilient crops. Professor Karl Blanchet, of Geneva University's Centre for Humanitarian Studies, believes the aid agencies are being set up to fail: ""The decision has already been made. It's highly likely the US is going to stop its involvement in any UN system. ""It's multilateralism versus America first - these are two ends of a spectrum."" Aid agencies working on complex humanitarian operations are more blunt. ""It's like being asked 'have you stopped beating your child, yes or no?'"" said one frustrated aid worker. The UN aid agencies believe the questionnaire misunderstands their core principles of neutrality and impartiality - that people suffering because of war or natural disaster should be helped regardless of political beliefs, and that aid should not be used as a tool to strengthen one particular nation. UN Human Rights has already chosen not to fill out the form. ""Given they were mostly yes/no questions with very limited room for elaboration, and that some of the questions were not applicable to the UN, we were not in a position to reply directly to the online questionnaires,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""Instead, we provided replies by email with explanations to those questions where we could provide a response."" Some of the questions also reflect the economic interests of President Trump's administration. There is a query about projects which might affect ""efforts to strengthen US supply chains or secure rare earth minerals"". The BBC has approached the OMB and the US missions at the United Nations in New York and Geneva for comment.

"Islamic State leader in Iraq and Syria killed, US says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q451y218go,"A senior Islamic State (IS) group leader in Iraq and Syria has been killed in an operation by members of the Iraqi national intelligence service along with US-led coalition forces, the Iraqi prime minister has said. Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rifai, also known as Abu Khadijah, ""was considered one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world"", according to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. US President Donald Trump said ""he was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters"". The US Central Command (Centcom) said it conducted a ""precision airstrike""  in Iraq's western Al Anbar province, which killed ""one of the most important"" IS members on Thursday. Rifai was the head of IS's most senior decision-making body and was responsible for operations, logistics, and planning conducted by IS globally,  the US Central Command said. He also directed a large portion of finance for the group's global organisation, Centcom added. Posting on his Truth Social platform, President Trump said: ""His miserable life was terminated, along with another member of ISIS, in coordination with the Iraqi Government and the Kurdish Regional Government. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!"" Rifai was found dead alongside one other IS operative, Centcom said. ""Both terrorists were wearing unexploded 'suicide vests' and had multiple weapons,"" it added. Centcom and Iraqi forces were able to identify him through a DNA match from DNA collected on a previous raid where he ""narrowly escaped"", it added. Gen Michael Erik Kurilla said Rifai ""was one of the most important IS members in the entire global IS organisation. ""We will continue to kill terrorists and dismantle their organizations that threaten our homeland and US, allied and partner personnel in the region and beyond."" IS once held 88,000sq km (34,000sq miles) of territory stretching from north-eastern Syria across northern Iraq and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. Iraq declared the defeat of IS in December 2017 and the group was driven from its last piece of territory in 2019. However militants and sleeper cells continue to have a presence in various parts of the country and carry out sporadic attacks against Iraq's army and police.

14 things the Trump administration did this week,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjx2erlxlo,"The eighth week of Donald Trump's second term has been marked by the dizzying ping-pong of tariffs and counter-tariffs, and Ukraine peace talks with officials from both Kyiv and Moscow. The US president and his administration continue to make headlines as they forge ahead with their policies. Here's a quick look at some of their biggest recent moves. Trump went ahead with his plan for a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium products coming from the rest of the world. But his team halted its plan to double US tariffs on imports of Canadian steel and aluminium to 50%, only hours after threatening America's northern neighbour in another skirmish in their trade war. The rollback came after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his province would suspend new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends across the border. ""Cooler heads prevailed,"" Peter Navarro, a trade adviser in the White House, told broadcaster CNBC. Tariffs and the unpredictable threats of new ones raised concerns among investors, particularly in light of a question Trump appeared to dodge over the weekend about whether the US economy was headed for a downward turn. In an interview on Fox News, the president who presides over the world's largest economy refused to be drawn on a question about whether there was a recession on the horizon - saying instead that the US was in a ""period of transition"" because ""what we're doing is very big"". Those words seemed to do little to reassure confidence among investors, as the US S&P 500 share index fell nearly 3% the next day. US allies across the Atlantic also weren't spared by Trump's tariff threats, as he took to his Truth Social network on Thursday to threaten European Union countries with a 200% tariff on alcohol. His alcohol tariffs are the latest escalation in a separate trade war with EU nations, who earlier that day unveiled their own counter-tariffs to Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. Trump - who has eschewed alcohol his whole life - highlighted in his social media post that the whopping 200% tariff would only cease once the EU stops a ""nasty 50% tariff on whisky"". He called the union ""hostile and abusive"". Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ""temperature was brought down"" this week between the US and Canada thanks largely to an olive branch that was extended by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The two nations struck a more diplomatic tone by the end of the week - which begun with a frenzy of tariffs and counter-tariffs. Ford, who just last weekthreatened to turn off the powerthat Canada provides to the US, emerged from an hours-long sit-down in Washington DC with Lutnick, saying: ""I can honestly say that was the best meeting I've ever had coming down here."" A proposal for a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine was unveiled this week in Saudi Arabia. It was the most recent step in the Trump administration's plans to secure peace in the region after more than three years of full-scale war. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz met a Ukrainian team for several hours on Tuesday. Afterwards, Kyiv said it was ready to support the immediate pause in fighting. A separate team of US officials, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow on Thursday to discuss the terms with Russian officials. He was met by President Vladimir Putin, who said afterwards there was still ""a lot ahead to be done"" on a ceasefire deal. Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia did prompt some action. The US delegation said afterwards it would resume sending military aid to Ukraine and sharing intelligence with the embattled country - with whom its relations have recently soured. The announcement came just days after the Pentagon announced that it would suspend sharing satellite imagery with Ukraine - technology that Kyiv relies on for tracking the movements of Russian troops and missile attacks. As part of its drive to cut government cuts, the administration scrapped funding for $20bn (£15.4bn) worth of Biden-era climate and environmental grants on Tuesday. The projects had been frozen for weeks. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also announced plans to end the funding for more than 400 diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice grants with about $1.7bn. A federal judge pressed the government's lawyers on Wednesday to present ""some kind of evidence"" that these grants were ""unlawfully done"". The administration tried to deport a permanent legal US resident and Columbia University graduate for his participation in 2024 protests at the campus over the war in Gaza. The attempt is now the subject of a legal battle. Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was considered one of the faces of the movement at Columbia, has been held at a detention centre in Louisiana where he was sent after his arrest in New York. Khalil's arrest, Trump has said, was one of ""many to come"" and arrived not long after his administration announced that it was cutting off $400m (£309m) worth of grants to Columbia University because it had failed to fight antisemitism on campus. The university has pledged to get its funding restored. The Department of Education announced this week that it planned to lay off 1,300 workers, a move that will effectively slash the department's workforce in half. Tasked with managing federal loans for college and enforcing civil rights law in school, the department has long been eyed by Trump and some conservatives to be eliminated altogether - although such an action would require Congress approval. Staff at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were told to ""shred as many documents"" and personnel files as they could this week, as the weeks-long purge on the agency has left the vast majority of its initiatives hollowed out. After exhausting that option, staff were instructed, they should then turn to ""burn bags"". The request, which raised alarm among employees and labour groups, comes as Secretary of State Rubio confirmed that 83% of the long-running aid programmes managed under USAID have now been terminated. Trump engaged in a different kind of diplomacy when he penned his thoughts on a piece of paper rather than tagging a foreign leader in a social media post. In a letter addressed to Iran's supreme leader, passed through an official from the UAE, the US president said he'd set out plans for negotiations over Tehran's nuclear programme. His warnings of facing potential military action unless talks were agreed to seem to have fallen on uninterested ears - as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the idea of negotiations, calling it ""deception of public opinion"". Dave Weldon, the Republican tipped to head the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), was withdrawn by the Trump administration to be its candidate for the public health agency - the decision coming only hours before he was set to testify before a Senate committee. The 71-year-old doctor and former Florida congressman was said by the White House to ""not have the votes in the Senate"" to be confirmed, an official told CBS News, BBC's news partner. Up until now, all of Trump's picks - including some of his more controversial ones - have been approved. Tesla facilities across the US were faced with protesters who stood outside the electric car manufacturers doors to call out its founder - Elon Musk - for the new role he plays in Donald Trump's administration. The ""Tesla takedown"" protests have been largely peaceful, but a few in parts of the country have ended with fires being lit in showrooms. This prompted Musk's new boss to proclaim that these individuals should be labelled domestic terrorists, as he held an event on the White House lawn showcasing the tech billionaire's product. While the pair sat in the front seat of one of the electric cars, Trump told the media he planned to buy it. During his Oval Office visit this week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin presented Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks. JD Vance, who attended the same meeting, didn't miss his own chance to pay homage to the Irish prime minister, donning a pair of cream-coloured socks that were - fittingly - adorned with green shamrocks. The gift of the traditional shamrock bowl was given a warm reception by the president, while the vice-president's attempts at celebrating the heritage of the Emerald Isle was less so. ""What's with these socks?"" the president asked, as the room erupted in laughter. The group were discussing inflation, but the socks proved to be a central talking point, too. ""I'm trying to stay focused, but I'm very impressed with the VP's socks."" The US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification. The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks. A judge ordered a 14-day halt on deporting Venezuelans under a Trump order that declared them enemies. Campaigners in St Louis want support for those who claim to have become ill due to research into the atomic bomb.

'We're trying to invoke emotion': Stadium architects on what CGI tells fans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewkzk5qv0lo,"In the world of billionaires and the similarly wealthy teams they own, designing a state-of-the-art stadium goes beyond the visual. In the offices of architecture firm Arup, there is a downstairs soundproof room with premium grade surround-sound speakers and a large screen. It looks like a small theatre. ""We can put a client in there and say, 'when your team scores, this is what it will sound like if your stadium roof is shaped this way,'"" says Chris Dite, who is responsible for the firm's sports projects. ""But, if we change the roof shape to this, then this is what it will sound like."" The way the pitch and intensity of the crowd noise changes in the aftermath of a goal is based on data from stadium projects the firm have completed over the last 25 years. Dite's previous work includes the Allianz Arena used by German football giants Bayern Munich and the Gtech Community Stadium where Brentford play. ""If you can sit the client in those front rows and make them feel like they're in it, that's where you start to really invoke an emotional response,"" Dite tells BBC News. What a goal might sound like in the new Manchester United stadium wasnot part of the presentation given by the club earlier this week,but the design of the new £2bn ground certainly invoked emotional responses. Some questioned how realistic it was to build such tall pillars from which a glass panelled canvas drapes over the new stands and surrounding grounds. The three pillars in the artist's impression, unveiled by the firm Foster and Partners, are a nod to the trident on the Red Devil's crest. ""Gravity still exists, unfortunately for us,"" remarks Dite. He says he ""can't comment on other architectural businesses"" but that Arup doesn't issue any public designs that haven't been approved by structural engineers. ""We don't want to get into the situation of showing a client or fans an image that everyone falls in love with, that everybody gets behind. ""And then, when it comes to being a finished building, everyone's like 'well, that doesn't look anything like the picture'."" Prof Kevin Singh, head of the Manchester School of Architecture, explains modern building techniques mean many of an architect's ideas are possible to construct, though there are limitations. Housing and infrastructure that surround an existing stadium, particularly in an inner city or residential area, can limit the scope of ambitious redevelopment. Both Liverpool and Newcastle United have had difficulties expanding their grounds due to their close proximity to houses. One stand at Luton Town can only be accessed through anentrance sandwiched between a long row of terraced housing.Fans pass through a tight corridor before climbing staircases overlooking gardens of neighbouring properties. Singh points towards the way Fulham have redeveloped Craven Cottage in a residential part of west London andEverton's new ground at Bramley-Moore Dockas good examples of stadiums that ""fit into its place"". He said: ""Everton's feels contextual. You know it's on the dock and it has some nods to Goodison Park,"" he told the BBC. ""When you saw the images of the stadium, it looked like the sort of thing you would build there."" In contrast, he thinks Man Utd have chosen to construct something striking that can't be confused for any other stadium. ""It's very much an iconic thing in itself,"" he says. ""They're justifying that sort of design because of the trident."" Singh adds: ""I think nobody could say that the proposal for Old Trafford is like anything else. I think avoiding anonymity was probably a key consideration."" Dite agrees, saying how much a stadium stands out in its local area is often something that has to be discussed with planners. ""Some buildings make the statement that 'I want to be seen' … I think Tottenham's stadium does that and certainly the images we've seen this week from Manchester show it's a statement – an iconic piece of architecture."" He adds: ""A lot of that is around the client's appetite to make a statement."" For Singh this goes hand in hand with a club's wider ambitions around branding and what message it is trying to convey about itself. ""We're in a world now where brand is so important … Anybody can support a team from anywhere – you can watch every single game on TV,"" he says. ""It's a global marketplace now and so clubs are competing, you know, all over the world for fans and their attention. So they have an identity in mind and, of course, their stadium is a huge part of that."" Club greats and the local mayor hail the project as giving the club the world-leading stadium it deserves. Some fans are stunned by this exciting look into the future while others feel it looks like a generic entertainment venue devoid of local connection. Fans of rival clubs have commented it looks like a circus tent, a fitting reflection of the woes suffered bythe Premier League's most valuable team- they are 15th in the table. For Dite, as much as modern stadium design now includes acoustic considerations and brand messaging, the core tenets have long been the same. ""It is not wildly different from when the Colosseum was built 2,000 years ago"", he says. ""That spectators are really participants who want to be part of something bigger than themselves. ""You know what it's like, when it's the last five minutes of a close game, everyone gets behind the team. ""It becomes a collective experience. You're not watching the action, you're in it.""

US rejects 'impractical' Hamas demands as Gaza truce hangs in balance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7230vrkmko,"Talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have failed to reach an agreement, a Palestinian official has told the BBC, as the US accused Hamas of making ""entirely impractical"" demands at meetings in Qatar. Negotiators have been trying to find a way forward after the first phase of the temporary truce ended on 1 March. The US proposed to extend the first phase until mid-April, including a further exchange of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But the Palestinian official familiar with the talks, who did not wished to be named, said Israel and Hamas disagreed over key aspects of the deal set out by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the indirect talks. On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel was prepared to continue negotiations with Hamas on extending the ceasefire in Gaza. The comments came after Netanyahu met top aides and security officials. His office said the decision was a response to what Israel had heard from mediators on US proposals for 11 living Israeli hostages to be released, and the bodies of half of the deceased hostages. The White House accused Hamas of making ""entirely impractical"" demands in its response to Witkoff's proposal. It would extend the ceasefire into April but delay the negotiation of a permanent end to the war. A statement from Witkoff's office and the US National Security Council on Friday said: ""Hamas is making a very bad bet that time is on its side. It is not."" ""Hamas is well aware of the deadline, and should know that we will respond accordingly if that deadline passes."" A Hamas statement seen by the BBC said negotiations had broken down. Netanyahu's office had earlier said Israel accepted the US proposal. It said Hamas remained ""firm in its refusal and has not budged a millimetre,"" accusing the group of ""manipulation and psychological warfare"". Israel and Hamas agreed toa ceasefire deal involving three stagesin January, after 15 months of war. In the first stage, Hamas returned 25 living Israeli hostages, the remains of eight others, and five living Thai hostages. Israel released about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in exchange. The deal says stage two will include the remaining living hostages in Gaza exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners. But both sides currently disagree on the number of hostages due to be released next. They also disagree on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, which the original deal states should be happening by now. Israel resists this point, while Hamas insists it should happen. Earlier in March, Israelblocked aid shipmentsto Gaza and then cut electricity,saying it aimed to put pressure on Hamas. It is believed that Hamas is still holding up to 24 living hostages in Gaza and the remains of 35 others. As indirect talks continued on Friday, the group said in a statement it was ready to release the last living Israeli-American hostage it is known to be holding. Edan Alexander, 21, was serving as an Israeli soldier close to Gaza when he was taken. Under the terms of the original ceasefire agreement, it was expected that he would have been among the last hostages to be released. The group also said it would hand over the remains of four other dual nationals captured during the 7 October 2023 attacks. It did not give further details or make clear what it would demand in return. Witkoff dismissed the offer, saying Hamas was trying to appear flexible in public while being impractical in private. The attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, with 251 taken hostage. The assault triggered an Israeli military offensive that has since killed more than 48,520 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which are used by the UN and others. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times. An estimated70% of buildingshave been damaged or destroyed, healthcare, water, and sanitation systems have collapsed and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

North Sea collision ship captain appears in court,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20d44dvx0ro,"The captain of a cargo ship that collided with an oil tanker in the North Sea has appeared in court charged with gross negligence manslaughter over the death of a crew member. The Portuguese-flagged Solong and US-registered tanker Stena Immaculate crashed off the East Yorkshire coast at about 10:00 GMT on Monday. Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, was named as the crew member of the Solong who was missing and presumed dead, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Vladimir Motin, 59, of Primorsky in St Petersburg, Russia, captain of the Solong, did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody by Hull magistrates to appear before the Central Criminal Court in London on April 14. Mr Motin stood in the glass-front dock at Hull Magistrates' Court for the 35-minute hearing. He spoke through a translator to confirm his name, age and address, and that he understood the charges. The court heard how all 23 people on the tanker were rescued along with 13 of 14 crew members from the Solong but that Mr Pernia could not be located. Humberside Police arrested Mr Motin on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter on Monday evening, hours after the collision. The force said he had been charged on Friday evening. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) is trying to establish the cause of the crash. It said initial inquiries found the Solong was travelling from Grangemouth to Rotterdam and had often sailed the same route. ""At 09:47 GMT it struck the Stena Immaculate that was at anchor off the entrance to the River Humber,"" the MAIB said. On Friday, Stena Bulk said salvage experts from SMIT Salvage had successfully boarded Stena Immaculate to conduct a thorough assessment. The vessel was carrying 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel. The Stena Immaculate is still at anchor at the point where the collision happened, which is about 12 miles off the East Yorkshire coast, near Withernsea. The MAIB said the salvage process was ""necessarily methodical, comprehensive and ongoing"" and would ""require time to complete fully"". Chief coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said that aerial surveillance flights continued to monitor the vessels and confirmed ""there continues to be no cause for concern from pollution"" from either ship. All 23 crew on board Stena Immaculate were Americans who are currently in Grimsby and are likely to be repatriated in due course, the BBC understands.

"Aid workers killed in Israeli air strike in Gaza, charity tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20d4ylyx57o,"A team of charity workers has been killed in Israeli strikes in northern Gaza, the UK-registered Al Khair Foundation has told the BBC. The charity said eight people - including its volunteers and independent journalists documenting their activities - were killed when their vehicles were targeted on Saturday in what Hamas described as a ""blatant violation"" of the ceasefire agreement with Israel. The Israeli military has said it had struck ""two terrorists who were identified operating a drone that posed a threat to Israeli troops"", adding that it then targeted ""additional terrorists"" who arrived at the scene. The charity rejects the allegation that members of its team were terrorists. Qasim Rashid Ahmad, founder and chairman of the charity, told the BBC the team was in the area to set up tents and document it for the charity's own promotion efforts. He said that the cameramen came back to the car and were hit, while its team members who rushed to the scene were then struck by an Israeli drone which had followed them when they went to the charity's second car. But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted people operating a drone who posed a threat to Israeli troops in Beit Lahia, adding: ""Later, a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle. The IDF struck the terrorists."" Video editor Bilal Abu Matar and cameramen Mahmoud Al-Sarraj, Bilal Aqila and Mahmoud Asleem were all named as having been killed in the strike, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate. The organisation accused Israel of carrying out ""systematic targeting of Palestinian journalists, who risk their lives to report the truth and expose Israeli crimes to the world"". Several others were injured in the strike, and rushed to the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run health ministry said. A spokesman for the group, Hazem Qassem, accused Israel of having ""committed a horrific massacre in the northern Gaza Strip"". A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been in place since January, after 15 months of fighting, but its future is uncertain as the process has reached an impasse. The first phase of the multi-stage deal saw Hamas return dozens of hostages, both alive and dead, that it had captured during its attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Talks to extend the first phase of the ceasefire - which ended on 1 March - ended without an agreement,a Palestinian official told the BBC on Saturday. Negotiators were working on a US-proposed extension, which would include a further exchange of hostages and prisoners. Washington accused Hamas of making ""entirely impractical"" demands. The group has demanded immediate talks on the second phase, including discussions of a permanent ceasefire, as laid out inthe agreement brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US in January. Hamas's unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October 2023 saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded with a massive military offensive on the Palestinian territory, which has killed more than 48,300 people, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Its overtures towards the Druze is part of strengthening its defences against Syria's new leaders. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are meeting mediators for the first time since the truce began in January. Philippe Lazzarini warns of a renewed hunger crisis unless aid and electricity supplies resume. Eli Cohen's announcement on Sunday came one week after Israel cut off all aid supplies to the territory.

"Netflix's $320m sci-fi blockbuster is 'soulless', 'dumb' and a hit",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdelxr18pzlo,"Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop. Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State. It is ""a turgid eyesore"" and ""top-dollar tedium"", according tothe Times. It's ""slick but dismally soulless"", declaredthe Hollywood Reporter, whilethe New York Timescalled it  ""obvious, garish and just plain dumb"". Pastepointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as ""the most banal way you can spend $320m"". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as ""one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle"". There have been some kinder reviews.Empiresaid it was ""breezily watchable"" and worth three stars, whilethe Telegraphawarded four stars to the ""Spielbergian treat"". But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (£247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever. Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday. It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers. ""I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,"" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell. Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are ""decent"", the robots are ""impressive"" and the finale is ""epic"". ""My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,"" he says. Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. ""But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all."" While a critic's job is to a analyse a movie, ""audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars"", he adds. The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots. It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon Stålenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology. The film is ""absolutely not"" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford. And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says. The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements. ""The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,"" Luxford says. ""The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's."" Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating. Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers. Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%. They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as ""another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry"" - summing up this new genre. In December,N+1 magazine quotedseveral screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing ""so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along"". ""Electric State does feel like that,"" Sandwell continues, ""where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along. ""But it does depend on the movie."" Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts. Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are ""very average"", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State. ""Netflix know what they're doing,"" he says. ""They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it. ""But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners. ""And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point."" The legendary actor's three children may still have a claim to his fortune under state laws, legal experts say. The film is due for release in the summer and was filmed at home of the British Grand Prix. The festival aims to ""to put the South West on the map"", organisers say. Cult classic Blue Juice is still wowing audiences in Cornwall, 30 years after its first release. The 1995 teen film has been brought to the stage in London's West End, with music by KT Tunstall.

'Ireland has entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp' - Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx29lwy8k73o,"US President Donald Trump has raised a ""massive"" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US ""very badly"".

Trump blocked from using wartime law for deportations,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89yk405lg9o,"A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump from using a 227-year-old law meant to protect the US during wartime to carry out mass deportations of Venezuelans. Trump on Saturday proclaimed immigrants belonging to the Venezuelan crime gang Tren de Aragua were ""conducting irregular warfare"" against the US and that he would deport them under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. But US District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday evening ordered a halt to deportations covered by the proclamation that will last for 14 days, according to media reports. Judge Boasberg told a hearing he had heard planes with deportees were taking off and ordered them turned back, the Washington Post reported. The law allows the US during wartime to detain and remove people threatening the country's safety without having to follow due process. It was last invoked to intern people of Japanese descent during World War Two. There was little surprise to the proclamation on Saturday, where Trump declared Tren de Aragua was ""perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States"". He had promised to use the controversial law for mass deportations during last year's campaign. The American Civil Liberties Union and other rights group had already sued to block him from using it on Saturday before he issued the proclamation, as well. At a hearing, the judge said the terms ""invasion"" and ""predatory incursion"" in the law ""really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by enemy nations,"" and the law probably did not offer a good basis for Trump's proclamation, according to the New York Times. An ACLU lawyer had told the New York Times he believed there were two planes of Venezuelan immigrants in the air on Sunday. The BBC has not verified that report. The case will now move through the legal system and could go all the way to the Supreme Court. The proclamation, and the fight around it, should rally Trump's supporters, who largely returned him to the White House on his pledges to crack down on illegal immigration and bring down prices of everyday goods. Since he was inaugurated in January, he has swiftly worked to overhaul the US immigration system. Rights groups, along with some legal experts, are calling the invocation unprecedented, noting the Alien Enemies Act has been used in the past after the US officially declared war against other countries. Under the constitution, only Congress can declare war. All Venezuelan citizens in the US who are at least 14 years old, members of Tren de Aragua and ""are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents"" were to be  ""apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies"", under Trump's order. Trump did not lay out in the proclamation how US officials would determine that a person is a member of the violent, transnational gang. By using this law, instead of immigration laws that already give him ""ample authority"" to deport the gang's members, Trump would not have to prove that detainees are part of Tren de Aragua, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in a statement. ""He wants to bypass any need to provide evidence or to convince a judge that someone is actually a gang member before deporting them,"" she said. ""The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings."" The unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks. Campaigners in St Louis want support for those who claim to have become ill due to research into the atomic bomb. At least 20 people have died after tornadoes and severe storms tore through central and southern states. The legendary actor's three children may still have a claim to his fortune under state laws, legal experts say.
